# Introduction

Robert and David are teaming up to demonstrate two projects that are enabled by the Arm Innovator Program.  The Solar-powered Mobile Developer Workstation is a project that places a 96Boards Arm single board computer, battery, solar charging unit, LCD panel, and standard electric sockets in to a suitcase-like enclosure that can be deployed anywhere.  With the addition of an LTE and sensor mezzanine, the device can remotely monitor environmental conditions, as well.  Adding further to the demo, miniNodes is placing a small carrier board inside the box that holds 5 Raspberry Pi Computer-on-Modules, that can add additional compute capacity and run small, specialized workloads or containers that can be remotely deployed to to the box.  This allows remote management and updating, even at extreme edge locations, as long as there is cellular coverage.

# Hardware

Equipment supplied with demo:  The Mobile Developer Workstation will be entirely self contained.  Beyond that, perhaps we bring a few additional 96Boards SBC's and a few extra Raspberry Pi SoM's so people can pick up and examine them, mostly just as novelty items.

Equipment to be supplied by Arm: Screen

Power & sockets:  @Robert - how long do you expect the battery to last, I don't think we will get good charging through the solar panels indoors (unless we are near a window, ha)...Can we plug the unit directly into an electrical socket and run on regular power if need be?     Other than that, maybe 2 or 3 sockets is all we need, for occasional laptop and cell phone charging.

Internet:  WiFi would be nice to have for any laptops we bring for pulling up info as requested by visitors, but, the demo box itself will actually be using 4G LTE, so we could survive without.
